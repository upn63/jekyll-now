title: Week 10 - Project 4 Darwin
---

On Monday, we talked about our next project. I like that Professor Downing talks to us about how we should implement our projects. The project spec is sometimes a little bare but Professor Downing always gives us good insight and gives us some guidance and a starting point.

Wednesday, we had Conrad Stoll from Mutual Mobile here in Austin. He spoke extensively about the what, why, and hows of open source contribution. I knew of Mutual Mobile because the founders of the company spoke at MAD's developer conference two years ago. Conrad said the reason companies allow their employees to work on open source projects during work hours is because it gets the name of the company out and the company uses open source projects to help their own projects. I particularly enjoyed this speaker because he gave very unique content and talked about something more than just his day to day job and what the company does.
