title: OOP Week 4 - Voting Project
---

The first project was due last week and I'm anxious to receive my grade. Starting the 2nd project was enjoyable because we got to pair up. We get extra points, 2 brains > 1 brain, and more fun to be had when programming together so I say pair programming is a must. My partner and I have already cranked through a decent amount of it in just 4 hours total this past week. The Voting project seems fairly simple so far but the schedule this coming week will be hectic because it's recruiting season and the CNS career fair is tomorrow. 

As Professor Downing has reiterated: "Move heaven and earth to find a job/internship next summer." I like that he encourages us to pursue our careers and put school second on the priority list (at least that's what I assume he's implying). I asked him to excuse my absence since I will miss class tomorrow for the fair and he was very understanding. 

Tip of the Week: Talk to Professor Downing because he's considerate of your opinions and a very approachable man. Especially when he's not asking you hard questions during class.

Tip of the Week #2: "It doesn't compile" is the correct answer.... a lot of the time.
