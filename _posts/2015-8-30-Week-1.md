Coming into the course, I've heard and seen many compliments on Professor Downing's teaching style and content. The way he spoke in the first day of class clearly showed his goal of pushing the students to an industry ready level of competence. After giving his spiel of what we will learn and why it's relevant, we methodically went through code as he randomly calls on students. This was a fun memory of what my high school math teacher called the "randomizer", a small program that picks out a student from the pool of names as we all watched anxiously.

Tip of the Week
My tip of the week is to not be intimidated by the vast talent in the course and engage with Professor Downing if called on. I truly respect the way he patiently waits and calmly asks students questions without giving an heir of patronization.
