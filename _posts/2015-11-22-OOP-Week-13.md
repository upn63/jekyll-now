title: OOP Week 13 - Stuff 
--- 
We are approaching the end of the semester! This week, the third to last week, we talked extensively about method overloading and abstract classes. If a method is pure virtual, that means the class in which the method resides is abstract and all descendants must define that method. Virtual methods enable dynamic binding. If a method is not declared virtual, its behavior defaults to being static. Something that is interesting is that abstract classes CAN have constructors despite abstract classes not having the ability to be instantiated. 

An undesirable way to implement methods is by making a method virtual but not making pure virtual. The reason this is dangerous is because if the parent class changes its signature, descendent classes will no longer be overriding that method anymore and calls will go to the parent class.

I’m curious about what our second test will be like. It seems like this one will have a lot of inheritance based implementations with static/non-static field variables, virtual methods, and overloading methods. I will have to study over Thanksgiving since the test is the following week.

Tip of the Week<br/>
Read the assigned readings! Even if Professor Downing doesn’t put questions about them in the quizzes, the articles have interesting and relevant topics that make you more knowledgeable about this field.
