title: OOP Week 5 - Career Fair
---

The time has finally come! I was called on to answer a question during class. It was an easy question since a similar question had been asked just a few minutes prior. The question was how to implement a function using templates (similar to Generics in Java). 

This past Monday was the career fair and the first time this semester that Professor Downing didn't take attendence or give a quiz via TopHat. On Wednesday, we had a speaker from NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab come and talk to us about what he has been working on. Alex Menzies has been contributing as a software developer for their rovers on Mars and told us what techniques the lab has been trying out to control robotic arms. The first one that everyone knows of is a technique where the robotic arm replicates a human's movement through a camera. They decided that wasn't good enough so they used scaffolding.

Tip of the Week

Go to career fair! It's so important to make a personable impression. Making a connection face to face is much easier and much more memorable than submitting a resume online.
