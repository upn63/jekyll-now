title: SWE Week 16 - Final Week
---
<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This past week, my partners and I presented our video game database website on Monday. Our site's URL is GGMate.me. We created an interactive and immersive experience into the video game world. The three pillars of content of our site are games, companies, and people. The group who we had to critique made a nice website about books and authors.

The only thing left in the way between me and my summer is my matrices final on the last day of finals. Another thing holding me back is trying to get this post to show up on my Jekyll blog. I can't get the post to show for some reason. This has happened to me before but I don't remember how I fixed it.
<p align="center"> What will you do next week? </p>
Next week, I will study for my matrices final.

Enjoy the summer! Try and get an internship because that is an important piece to your resume and to your portfolio.
