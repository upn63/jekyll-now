<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This past week, my partners and I presented our video game database website on Monday. Our site's URL is GGMate.me. We created an interactive and immersive experience into the video game world. The three pillars of content of our site are games, companies, and people. The group who we had to critique made a nice website about books and authors.

Enjoy the summer! Try and find an internship because that's an important piece in building your resume and your portfolio.
