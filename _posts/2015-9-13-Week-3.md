title: Week 3 - Collatz Project
---




Our first project was due this past Wednesday. The most unsatisfying feeling in the world to me is to spend hours on code and make little to no progress. This is exactly what happened but luckily Thanh, one of the TAs, helped me out and saw that my cache stored the next value in the Collatz sequence rather than the cycle length of that value. I spent 2pm-7pm on Tuesday trying to implement a simple cache. 

Tip of the Week

Do your projects early so you have time to ask TAs or the professor for help!!
