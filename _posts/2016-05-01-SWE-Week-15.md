title: SWE Week 15 and 16 - Presentations and Final
---

<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This past week, my partners and I presented our video game database website on Monday. Our site's URL is GGMate.me. We created an interactive and immersive experience into the video game world. The three pillars of content of our site are games, companies, and people. The group who we had to critique made a nice website about books and authors.

The only thing left in the way between me and my summer is my matrices final on the last day of finals. Another thing holding me back is trying to get this post to show up on my Jekyll blog. I can't get the post to show for some reason. This has happened to me before but I don't remember how I fixed it.

Next week, I will study for my matrices final.

Enjoy the summer! Try and get an internship because that is an important piece to your resume and to your portfolio.

This past week, my partners and I worked on our group presentation for this coming Monday. This past Monday, we had our final, regular lecture about clones, the factory pattern, and the prototype pattern. Wednesday and Friday, we had group presentations and the websites other groups created were amazing. Hopefully, people have the same reaction to our site when we present. I looked for things people did in their presentation so that I could emulate them on Monday.

I have two other tests besides the SWE test on Thursday so I will have to manage my time wisely to study for all of them. Luckily, I started studying some last week.

This week, I will need to prepare for the SWE test on Thursday night and finish the semester off strong. I will go over all of the refactoring methods, SQL, and Javascript. I will code by hand to prep for the second and final exam for SWE.

Practice your presentation skills! Presentation and public speaking skills can take you a long way in addition to your technical abilities.
