title: SWE Week 14 - Projects Finished!
---

<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This past week, we finished our final project! In our final phase, we refined our tables, implemented back end pagination, and implemented another group's API. In class, we talked further about refactoring with reflections and singleton patterns. We also talked about dynamic binding and method overriding like in OOP.

<p align="center"> What's in your way? </p>
There is nothing in my way this week since there isn't a project due. I have a lot of tests on the final week of school but none of those classes have any finals, including this one.

<p align="center"> What will you do next week? </p>
This week, I will start studying for our second SWE test. I need to do well and go over all the ways of refactoring as well as JavaScript and SQL. 

<p align="center"> Tip of the Week </p>
Prepare for the SWE test early! Code by hand because when you hand write, it sticks in your mind.
