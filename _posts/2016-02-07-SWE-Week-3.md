title: SWE Week 3 - Tough Quizzes
---

What did you do this past week? 
<br/>
I double checked my Collatz project, improved my existing combination of lazy and meta cache, and turned in the JSON Canvas form for P1.

<br/><br/>
What's in your way? 
<br/>
So far, my 4/7 quiz scores are in my way of getting an A. The quizzes ask peculiar questions. This week, I was tricked by the way python handles additions to tuples when the tuple is referenced in another tuple.

<br/><br/>
What will you do next week?
<br/>
Next week, I will start P2.

<br/><br/>
Tip of the Week
<br/>
Always review your notes and read the articles to prepare for quizzes! Quizzes are 21% of your grade and are a massive component in your quest for an A in this course.
