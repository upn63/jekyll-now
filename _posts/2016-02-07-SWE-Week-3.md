title: SWE Week 3 - Tough Quizzes
---

<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This week, I improved my existing combination of lazy and meta cache, I double checked my Collatz project requirements, and I turned in the JSON Canvas form for the project. I also helped one of my friends with his understanding of the project earlier in the week. 

<p align="center"> What's in your way? </p>
So far, my 4/7 quiz scores are in my way of getting an A. The quizzes ask very peculiar questions. The quiz this past Friday, I was tricked by the way python handles additions to tuples when the tuple is referenced in another tuple. I have a case competition coming up this week and this will unfortunately prevent me from working on P2 as much as I would like.

<p align="center"> What will you do next week? </p>
Next week, I will start P2 with my partner and finish as much as we can this week. I like to knock things out early. Hopefully, any problems we encounter will be early so we can consult the TA during the Tuesday study sessions.

<p align="center"> Tip of the Week </p>
Always review your notes and read the articles to prepare for quizzes! Quizzes are 21% of your grade and are a massive component in your quest for an A in this course.
