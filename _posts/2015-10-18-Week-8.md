title: Week 8 - Project 3
---

Our next project is based on a first fit allocator that "mallocs" space. At first, it was intimidating because it seemed like we were going to write a program similar to the file system in PintOS. When my partner Bryan and I started however, we made good progress immediately and the project no longer seemed menacing.

On Friday, I missed class and was excused because I had an on-site interview. Thankfully I only have one class on Fridays and Professor Downing is understanding of career related obligations.

Tip of the Week

Start projects early because it gives you (and your partner) an opportunity to seek help from TAs if you get stuck. Bryan and I got stuck on our Allocator project but since we started early, we had the chance to attend office hours the following day.
