title: SWE Week 2 - Class Speaking and Collatz
---

This week, we went over the technologies that we will be using in the class. Namely, unit testing and coverage software. It was introduced this week alongside our first project, the Collatz conjecture. We must make a method that finds the largest cycle length within a range of numbers and optimize with a meta or lazy cache.

I have finished the first project so it's nice that this week will be free-er for me. Luckily, I was able to catch some things I forgot to do after rereading the project instructions. I forgot to copy my TestCollatz.tmp output into TestCollatz.out. I had to update it in the public test repo as well.

Tip of the Week <br/>
ALWAYS reread the project specifications once finishing the project to double check anything you are missing.
