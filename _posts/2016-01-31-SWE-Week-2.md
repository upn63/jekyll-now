title: SWE Week 2 - Class Speaking and Collatz
---

This week, we went over the technologies that we will be using in the class. Namely, unit testing and coverage software. It was introduced this week alongside our first project, the Collatz conjecture. We must make a method that finds the largest cycle length within a range of numbers and optimize with a meta or lazy cache. I was also called on for the first time by Downing's randomizer. Luckily he didn't ask one of his infamous "Does this work?" questions.

I have finished the first project so it's nice that this week will be free-er for me. The large amount of project specs is intimidating but don't let it get to you. Take it one step at a time. Since I took OOP last semester, I'm already acclimated to this. I was able to catch some things I forgot to do after rereading the project instructions. I forgot to copy my TestCollatz.tmp output into TestCollatz.out. I had to update it in the public test repo as well. This coming week, I will hopefully get to start on P2 on Friday because of a busy week I have next week with a case competition.

Tip of the Week <br/>
ALWAYS reread the project specifications once finishing the project to double check anything you are missing.
