title: SWE Week 1 - Impressions
---

Week one of Software Engineering is much like the first week of OOP. Professor introduces his random name calling system, gave a brief overview of the class, and gave us our first quiz. Luckily, the quizzes are taken on Canvas rather than an app called TopHat (which was used in previous semesters) that students have to pay for. I took OOP last semester and it turned out to be a fantastic class with Professor Downing's attention to detail. That is my measuring stick for this class. The thing I'm looking forward to most is to get into the web development with Flask. I have .NET experience and Microsoft's web dev stack and I'd like to expand my knowledge and see what the open source world has to offer.

The first project has already been introduced. It involves the Collatz conjecture and an optimized solution that caches the cycle lengths of numbers.

Tip of the Week <br/>
Keep up with the readings and previous class material to maintain a high quiz average. The quiz grades are a big chunk of this class' grade distribution. The first quiz this past Friday didn't get me off to a good start with a 4/7 :/ but hopefully I'll turn it around!
