title: Week 7 - Test Week
---

This was a busy week for me but luckily, Professor Downing doesn't assign projects on test weeks. We had our first test this past Thursday night and it was good to get a feel for what Professor Downing likes to ask. The test had portions where the student was asked to implement certain functions and portions where the student was asked to implement the entire class. Studying for the test involved memorizing minute details because I wasn't sure if I needed to remember how to implement a Google test and I also needed to understand the differences between many uses of the key word "const" and also the differences between pointers and references. Luckily, we have an 8X11 cheat sheet.

Friday was canceled which was great because it was OU weekend. AND we won a close one! Hook 'em.

Tip of the Week

Study early and code to practice! Doing is learning. Doing > staring at a piece of paper.
