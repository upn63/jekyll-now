title: SWE Week 5 - Finished Netflix
---

<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
My partner and I finished our project two on Wednesday night despite our busy, non-aligning schedules. It was a thrill to see the RSME value dip under 0.95 for the first time. During class, we talked about different methods to compute RSME values with maps, lambda expressions, and generators. We also talked about yielding functions so that when the function is called again, it starts off at a certain spot rather than always starting from the beginning of the function.

The only thing in my way this week is a matrices test on Tuesday. Other than that, I am free this week to easily make time to keep up with SWE.

Next week, I will begin reviewing for our test on the following Thursday night. I will write Python code, read the Google doc, and go over the linked code on the course schedule. There are additional readings on Tuesday and Thursday night I will do so that I can get good quiz grades. Luckily, there isn't a project this week but I'm excited to start a website with project 3 in a few weeks.

Study for the tests early! Professor Downing often hints at what topic will be on the test so keep your ears peeled for those in class.
