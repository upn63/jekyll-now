title: SWE Week 11 - IDB Part 2
---

<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This past week, my partners and I started to set up our MySQL database. We are having some trouble setting it up because we have our models in a file called models.py but we're having difficulties importing the models into app.py for some reason. We refined our front end and so far it's looking great. There is a significant change from Phase 1 to Phase 2. In class, we covered XML and JSON. We also had a guest speaker from Atlassian who told us about a day in the life of a developer at the company. The company creates a variety of developer tools such as version control and a chat application. 

<p align="center"> What's in your way? </p>
What is in the way right now is getting MySQL to cooperate with Flask and SQLAlchemy. Our API also needs to be created this week before our project is due on Thursday. 

<p align="center"> What will you do next week? </p>
Next week, I will work on getting our database into the cloud, querying the database, and sending it up to the UI so that we can use AngularJS to dynamically create our grid.

<p align="center"> Tip of the Week </p>
Talk to the guest speakers if you have an interest in their company! The guest speakers work at great tech companies around Austin and them being in class is a great opportunity to look for a full time gig or an internship.
