title: Week 15 - Final Week, Final Exam 
--- 

We are done with Object Oriented Programming! With the class anyway. We've covered a plethora of material that will be requisite knowlege when coding in C++. Inheritance rules with virtual methods, reflection, and handlers are all extremely useful methodologies to create clean, and comprehensive code that requires the least maintenance as possible.

The second exam was very fair but I'm not sure I implemented certain portions correctly. It's nice that we don't have a final exam so that's one less exam in the next week and a half. Professor Downing used Canvas as a new way to administer the exam rather than traditional pencil and paper. We used Canvas and couldn't have anything else open on our browsers.

Tip of the Week

Take a break when you aren't making progress when studying and come back refreshed to be more efficient! Don't drag it on if you aren't making any progress. Churning through difficult material is a must at times but if nothing is happening, leave and come back.
