title: OOP Week 15 - Final Week, Final Exam 
--- 

We are done with Object Oriented Programming! With the class anyway. We've covered a plethora of material that will be requisite knowlege when coding in C++. Before I get into the overview of the class, I'll talk about this week. The second exam was very fair but I'm not sure I implemented certain portions correctly. It's nice that we don't have a final exam so that's one less exam in the next week and a half. Professor Downing used Canvas as a new way to administer the exam rather than traditional pencil and paper. We used Canvas and couldn't have anything else open on our browsers.

As for the class itself, it was well worth the work put into bi-weekly projects. The workload isn't horrible, but then again, no workload is horrible after taking 439. Some major concepts that I took away are inheritance rules with virtual methods, reflection, and handlers. All are extremely useful methodologies to create clean, and comprehensive code that requires the least maintenance as possible. I enjoyed that Professor Downing has a randomizer to call on students in class and make class engaging. 

Tip of the Week<br/>
Take a break when you aren't making progress when studying and come back refreshed to be more efficient! Don't drag it on if you aren't making any progress. Churning through difficult material is a must at times but if nothing is happening, leave and come back.
