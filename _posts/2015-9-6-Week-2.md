title: Week 2 - Collatz Project
---

Now that Week #2 has finished, we're fully in the swing of things and we've received our first project. Professor Downing has gone through the Collatz Project intstructions with fairly meticulous detail on multiple occasions this past week. This has helped a lot because everytime he goes over the project, I become more aware of what we need to do and how to do it. He has stressed the importance of testing and turning in the project with precision and attention to the instructions to make the job of the TAs easier.

We also went through additional details about the compilation of files and reference files with .h extensions. Other concepts covered included buffers, promotion and demotion when converting to different types, and protocols to declare the ending of an input stream.

The quizzes have been fairly challenging because they test one's knowledge and retention of the readings. This is my tip of the week: READ and do the assigned readings. Some of the questions are difficult reasoning problems that you may need to guess on.
