title: SWE Week 6 - Stuff

<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This past week, I kept up with lectures, read the articles assigned, and did well on the quizzes. We had a guest speaker from Mutual Mobile on Wednesday. His name is Conrad and I first learned of the company from a UMAD event last year. Their business revolves around creating iOS and Android mobile apps for customers. On Friday's quiz, Downing asked a question from a reading assigned on Tuesday for the first time. Luckily, I remembered the reading about "open for extension but closed for modification".
