title: SWE Week 7 - Test #1
---

<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This past week, I kept up with lectures, read the articles assigned, and did well on the quizzes. We had a guest speaker from Mutual Mobile on Wednesday. His name is Conrad and I first learned of the company from a UMAD event last year. Their business revolves around creating iOS and Android mobile apps for customers. On Friday's quiz, Downing asked a question from a reading assigned on Tuesday for the first time. Luckily, I remembered the reading about "open for extension but closed for modification".

There is nothing in my way because the SWE test is the only one I have this week

<p align="center"> What will you do next week? </p>
This week, we have a test Thursday night so I will start studying and coding out problems. Project 3 has not been assigned yet so that leaves me free to worry about the test.

Use your laptop IDE/terminal to code out problems you think Professor Downing will ask on the test! Now that the tests are on Canvas and on our laptops, using your laptop to practice and study is even more necessary than before.
