title: SWE Week 7 - Test #1

<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
Our first test was this past Thursday and it was more difficult than I expected. I put in the time and coded out questions on Tuesday and Wednesday. Despite the difficulty, I believe there was adequate time to go through the test and recheck it. Since I took OOP last semester, I was ready for the online Canvas format of the exam. Using the tab/indent button on the Canvas forms was useful for formatting. I thought I was prepared but I realized I didn't cover a certain portion of the material enough.

The thought of Spring Break coming is the only thing in my way. I have to maintain my focus for another week before I'm free for Spring Break vacation.

Next week, I think we will receive the specifications for Project 3. I will need to find partners for the project and start it and potentially work on it a little over Spring Break as well. I will keep up with the readings as usual and hopefully do well on the in-class quizzes.

Go back over your test once you finish! Checking back over your test for mistakes is a great way to save yourself from careless errors. If you're mentally exhausted from the test, take a 5-10 minute break if possible to allow your mind to quickly refresh and then go back and review your work.
