<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This past week, my partners and I worked on our group presentation for this coming Monday. This past Monday, we had our final, regular lecture about clones, the factory pattern, and the prototype pattern. Wednesday and Friday, we had group presentations and the websites other groups created were amazing. Hopefully, people have the same reaction to our site when we present. I looked for things people did in their presentation so that I could emulate them on Monday.

I have two other tests besides the SWE test on Thursday so I will have to manage my time wisely to study for all of them. Luckily, I started studying some last week.

This week, I will need to prepare for the SWE test on Thursday night and finish the semester off strong. I will go over all of the refactoring methods, SQL, and Javascript. I will code by hand to prep for the second and final exam for SWE.

<p align="center"> Tip of the Week </p>
Practice your presentation skills! Presentation and public speaking skills can take you a long way in addition to your technical abilities.
