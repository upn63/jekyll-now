title: SWE Week 8 - P3 and Spring Break!
---

<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This past week, we covered the specs of Project 3 on Monday. We are supposed to make a website that has a circular structure with pillars of content like IMDB. On Wednesday, Everett Toews from Rackspace came in to talk to us about how to spin up a Rackspace cloud server using containers rather than a tradition cloud VM. Containers are used because they are much more lightweight than virtual machines. I also started Project 3 this week with my partners. We are doing a website containing video game information such as game titles, companies/publishers, and developers and other integral people who contributed to the video game.

Right now, being in Los Angeles and on Spring Break is in my way of working. It's a great getaway for the week but when I get back, my team and I will be working hard to finish P3 due on the Thursday we come back.

<p align="center"> What will you do next week? </p>
Next week, I will finish up more of the lengthy, 2500 word technical report as well as start setting up the site.

Be efficient! When you do your work, put in the time AND the effort because if you get your work done, you can have your time to enjoy and relax.
