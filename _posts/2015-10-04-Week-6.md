title: OOP Week 6 - Academics
---

This was the most in depth week we've had so far. It was the first full week of lectures we've had in a while due to the career fair, speakers, and a holiday in the past. We talked extensively about iterators, implementing iterators, and lambda expressions.

I have started to prepare for the exam. Professor Downing told us that the exam will be strictly coding with no mention of the assigned weekly readings. To review, he suggested to go over all of the code we've written in class and to go back and look at our projects. This will definitely test the students in their knowledge of the 2nd project; it will reveal whether or not a partner was carried by the other.

Professor Downing has suggested studying in groups, splitting up the material and writing practice problems for one another. 

Tip of the Week

Pay attention and write down the code written in class. This is a necessity to have good material to review over for the test.
