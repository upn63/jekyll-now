title: Week 9 - Confusing Code
---

This week involved a lot of confusing C++ syntax and specifics. We went over how to implement a vector class using a user defined or standard library allocator. We also went over what methods come default or "for free" when declaring a new class. The course is flowing quickly and the projects are too. My partner and I finished our allocator project a day early and turned it in. Unfortunately, our git SHA was invalid because we hadn't pushed our latest commit yet. Luckily, since we turned in early, a gracious TA notified us that that was the case and we had time to fix it before the deadline. So as I said in my last tip of the week... do things early!!

Tip of the Week

Take notes and copy the code written in class. Professor Downing has code posted on the class OOP site but they are just tests. They show behavior of the classes he writes but they don't show implementation. To be successful on the tests, take notes!! It's the only way you can review them, understand, and ask questions.
