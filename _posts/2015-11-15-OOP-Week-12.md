title: OOP Week 12 - Life 
--- 

This week, Professor Downing introduced our Game of Life project. It was confusing at first because we have 2 types of cells: a Conway and a Fredkin cell. Both have to inherit from an AbstractCell abstract class. However, our internal storage container needs to be a vector<Cell>. The Cell class is supposed to be a wrapper class that simply holds a pointer to either a Fredkin or a Conway cell. We spent Monday talking about how we should go about our last project.

Wednesday, we had the 5th and final speaker. They were from Atlassian, a company that makes collaboration tools and is probably best known for Bitbucket, a version control software. They spoke extensively about the development cycle and scrum, an alternative project management methodology to the traditional waterfall approach. Scrum is a style where projects are divided up into "sprints" that are supposed to implement a certain set of features.

Friday, I was out of town and was excused because it was for an interview.

Tip of the Week

Ask for reasonable travel accomadations when interviewing. I had a direct flight back to Austin Friday night but some of the other interns had red eye flights that left at 1am Saturday morning, had 1 stop, and arrived at 7am. I thought this was somewhat unacceptable for the company to be cheap about their intern candidate's flights. Your time is worth a lot!
