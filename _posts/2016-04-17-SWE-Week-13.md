title: SWE Week 13 - IDB Phase 3
---

<p align="center"> What did you do this past week? </p>
This past week, our fifth and final project was given to us. It is phase three of the IDB project and the main features we have to implement include a search function and the implementation of another group's API. We want to refine our site from the second phase in addition to the new functions that phase three requires. 

<p align="center"> What's in your way? </p>
I have a networks project and a matrices test this week so I will have to utilize my time efficiently to get all of my work done in those classes in addition to completing Project 3. 

<p align="center"> What will you do next week? </p>
This week, I will finish Project 3. Test #2 is coming up soon so once I finish the project, I will start to review the material for the test.

<p align="center"> Tip of the Week </p>
Study early so when the test comes around, you just need to review and refine your knowledge rather than having to learn it last minute.
